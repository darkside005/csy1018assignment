		<h3>About Me</h3>
			<img src="images/rojal.jpg" alt="MEE">
				<p>Hy My name is Rojal Pradhan and I am completing the bachelor degree from NAMI college.I am really interested in coding, and developing the programs. I love coding and I was always curious about the computers. I am carrying a dream of becoming a developer or coder. I am familier with linux environment and java. I am also doing online course in python. I was interested in the computers when I was in class 8. It was the first time/ experience to use a computer in school. I became very curious how a computer works and why it is used? Actually I had lot of questions at that time. Maybe due to that curiousity I want to become a developer.

				<p>I am learning BSc (Hons) computing first year at NAMI(Naaya Ayaam Multi-Disciplinary Institude) partnership with University of Northampton. It has become nearly six months i joined this college and I am learly very new things in here. I am learning java, HTML 5, CSS 3 and other programming language. Everyday feel likes learning a new thing. NAMI College doesn't encourage on learning it also encourage us in different other things like sports, conducting programs, presentation etc. Nowadays I am learning python and C# language from the online course in edx.org which was suggestion from the teachers. According to me "Life may have many trouble and the only solution is to be motivated but you can't be dependent on the others you have to keep on motivating yourself".</p><br>
